# Ecommerce-Website
This project is an e-commerce website implemented using PHP and MySQL, designed to cater to three different user levels: guest, registered user, and admin, each with their specific access privileges. The site offers various features, including viewing products, adding them to the shopping cart, user registration, a dedicated member panel, viewing registered orders, editing entered information, and more, tailored for users. Additionally, the admin has access to a list of products, user accounts, registered orders, payment lists, and the ability to add products.
